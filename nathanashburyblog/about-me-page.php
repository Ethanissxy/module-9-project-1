            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Over the years I’ve trekked to many places and had a number of different occupations most of them involving writing because that’s what I enjoy and do well.</p>
            <p>So you could say that my passion is ideas. I like to write about them and talk about them and so enjoy a good story.</p>
            <p>About 9 years ago I started my own business and contract out to companies who need a script writer. My largest and longest running contract is with the ABC. Sixty percent of my workload is now working for the ABC and the rest of my work hours are spent writing and editing for smaller local production companies and some overseas companies.</p>
            <p>As a young adult I had returned to my home country, the UK, and after writing almost anything for almost anyone landed a job with the BBC as a script writer. I was eventually promoted to script editor doing such things as finding new script writers, developing storylines and ideas for series with other writers and making sure that scripts are ready and suitable for production.</p>
